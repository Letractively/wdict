This extension is based on "Easy BBcode" of X-DOS ( http://fluxbb.org/forums/post/9017/#p9017 )
Requirement: fluxBB 1.3-dev-r718

- Require a PHP script & run a function to show all buttons instead of write HTML code for all hooks
- Use CSS style for buttons. So you can customize easier.

I'm NOT a programmer, just copy/paste :-)
